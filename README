JoyceNet is a 2-layer LSTM Network meant to be trained on the first few chapters of the novel Finnegan's Wake, by James Joyce. Given a trained model as input (.h5 format), it will attempt to predict the following text up to some input length.

Ideally the finished version will hallucinate text in a manner similar to the writing style in Finnegan's Wake. A number of optimizations and tweaks need to be done, including changes to the architecture itself, in order to bring it up to par with what I'd like it to be.

Once I've trained a few successful models, they'll be uploaded here for others to experiment with.

Usage: 
python JoyceNet.py [model_name.h5]
